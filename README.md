# coloredLids

_coloredLids_ extends the _grayBoxes_ repository by deriving classes from _Model_. In _grayboxes_ class _Model_ provides just empty white boxes which have to be filled and "closed with a colored lid". The lid color of the white boxes in [Fig. 1](#figure-1-gray-box-models) indicate functionality for simulating heat transfer, fluid flow, mass transfer and structural mechanics.
